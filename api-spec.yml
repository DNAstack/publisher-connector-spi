            The value (e.g. `sha-256`) SHOULD be listed as `Hash Name String` in the https://www.iana.org/assignments/named-information/named-information.xhtml#hash-alg[IANA Named Information Hash Algorithm Registry].
            Other values MAY be used, as long as implementors are aware of the issues discussed in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6920#section-9.4[RFC6920].
            GA4GH may provide more explicit guidance for use of non-IANA-registered algorithms in the future.
            Until then, if implementors do choose such an algorithm (e.g. because it's implemented by their storage provider), they SHOULD use an existing
            standard `type` value such as `md5`, `etag`, `crc32c`, `trunc512`, or `sha1`.

            The 'source' field should only be present when the error originated in an attached data source backing the Search
            API. The value of source can be any of the following:
            1. A fully qualified table `name`
            2. Any prefix of a table `name` that ends before a `.` character in the name. For example
            if there is a table called `foo.bar.baz`, valid prefixes would be `foo` and `foo.bar`. Partial prefixes
            which do not end just before a `.`, are not valid. For example: `foo.b` and `fo` are not allowed.
            If the error originated inside the Search API implementation and is not associated with any particular table
            or group of tables, then the source must be absent. An example of this would be an error occurring from a bug
            in the implementation. Additionally, if the error is due to a bad request from the client, the source must
            also be absent.
